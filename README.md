## What I did?

Modified the script (from the link above) so, that it reacts to a given soundtrack based on its amplitude & frequency.

## What I learnt?

- Got to know the p5.js library
- Using sound to reactive art is cool
- Mathematics itself is art

## Future plans

- Learn more maths to strengthen foundation and be able to recognize patterns with its power
- Create own (reactive) art with maths
